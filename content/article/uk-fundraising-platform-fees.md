title: UK fundraising platforms with no fees don't exist, but this is how to make 15% more!
description: I built a calculator for the most popular UK fundraising platforms comparing fees against owning your own form using GiveWP or BeaconCRM, where you can keep the "fees covered" paid by donors and increase your charity's income.

**No web form should ever cost more than $25/month. After all, it's a form!** JustGiving, Donorbox, Raisely, FundraiserUp and a dozen other services exist. All of them take a cut from your donation income, recurring, forever!

They all say their services are "free", but are they really? **NOT at all and it's infuriating!** Let's talk about that.

Donation platforms are exploiting charities in the UK and globally. I am writing this article to raise awareness and offer a better choice.

_TLDR; You need to own your donation form: The "donor covers fees" will cost you thousands!_

## How does the calculator above work?

Check out the lost income calculator above that simulates incoming donations based on real data obtained through the charities I work with. I will help you estimate how much you'd lose by using each of the donation platforms listed compared to hosting your own form with a plugin like GiveWP.

In this article, I am going to focus on the UK, as that's where the 10 charities I worked with operate.

## Real data from 14,000 donations

| Amount Donated | Count | Percentage |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 3-4.99         | 2,222 | 15.8%      |
| 5-9.99         | 6,012 | 42.7%      |
| 10-19.99       | 5,121 | 36.4%      |
| 20-49.99       | 447   | 3.2%       |
| 50-99.99       | 88    | 0.6%       |
| 100-199.99     | 36    | 0.3%       |
| 200-499.99     | 22    | 0.2%       |
| 500-999.99     | 3     | 0.02%      |
| 1000+          | 3     | 0.02%      |

### Enthuse

They prompt donors for a tip of 7.5% and if you use anything except the most basic Donations Plan they charge your org another 5%. Not just that, they also take 5% from your GiftAid claim! Sheesh!

£3 -> 17%
£5 -> 13%
£10 -> 9.9%
£20 -> 8.4%
£50 -> 7.5%
£100 -> 7.2%
£200 -> 7.05%
£1000 -> 6.93%

- 5% from GiftAid claims.

> 6,600 searches per month (3rd most popular)

Above are just a few examples. All of these platforms run this way. It's called the "tip-based business model" and you want to **avoid this like it's the plague.**

### Let's compare Enthuse vs Raisely vs GiveWP

> TODO: Revise this section. Include a bit about GiveWP and their pricing.

Let's use £100 for clarity.

When your donor pays £107.50 for a donation (including Enthuse's 7.5%), **you receive £100** (minus Stripe fees), compared to receiving the full £107.50 (minus Stripe fees) with GiveWP configured with "cover fees at 7.5%".

So already you make 7.5% more. But that's not all. Enthuse also takes 5% from your 25% GiftAid income, that's another 1.25% gone.

Let's do some math:
1000 donations @ £10 per donation = £10,000.

**Enthuse**: Donors pay £10,750 (they ask for 7.5%), GiftAid is £2,500 -> Enthuse takes £750 "fees covered" + £125.00 from GiftAid = you lose **£875.00**.
**Raisely**: Donors pay £11,350 (for £10, they ask for 13.5%, less as amounts go up) -> Raisely takes £1,350 as "fees covered" = you lose **£1,350.00**.
**GiveWP**: You just pay for the form £22 per month ($350/year) for any number of donations!

It's an insane difference for very little in return!

### So how to avoid this tax on your non-profit's fundraising success?

Use a flat fee payment form. I compared multiple options and the best I found is GiveWP.

You pay $350/year (£22/month), and that's it.

> I DO NOT have any affiliation with GiveWP. I recommend GiveWP because they excel at what they do and their pricing model is an extremely reasonable flat rate of ~$350/year. Plus, most charities are already using Wordpress.

#### When does it make sense to use these platforms?

It only really makes sense for a charity to use a %-cut fundraising platform if you don't have a website or your charity is tiny (makes less than £250-£500 per month).

Also, the best I found is GiveWP, which is a Wordpress plugin. So if your charity's website is not running on Wordpress

### Other reasons to avoid donation platforms:

As if the above numbers aren't enough, you also end up with a vendor lock-in.

1. Your subscription and customer data are now held hostage by these platforms. Instead of the subscriptions and customer records living in your Stripe account, they now live in their Stripe account so that they can **take their cut as an "application fee" from your donations**.

   Check this out as an example (real-world screenshot):
   ![[Pasted image 20251114155208.png]]

2. Also, now because your customer data lives on their platform, you need to **pay for custom integrations with your CRM**.
   MoveData.io, as an example, charges $200 per month for a simple Raisely -> Salesforce integration.
   And don't even get me started on ducking (wink) Zapier! For 1000 donations per month x ~10 tasks per incoming donation = 10,000 tasks per month; Zapier's Team plan costs £198.01/mo - AS IF the 0.01 penny makes it cheap!
